## SwiftWamp - Swift WAMP implementation

SwiftWamp is a WAMP implementation in Swift.
SwiftWamp is a based to [Swamp 0.1.0](https://github.com/iscriptology/swamp/releases/tag/0.1.0)

It currently supports calling remote procedures, subscribing on topics, and publishing events. It also supports authentication using ticket & wampcra authentication.

SwiftWamp `0.2.6` use WebSockets as its only available transport, and JSON as its serialization method.

Contributions will be merged gladly!

## Requirements
iOS 8.0

## Installation
SwiftWamp is available through cocoapods. Add

```ruby
pod "SwiftWamp"
```

to your Podfile.

## Usage
#### Connect to router

```swift
import SwiftWamp

let swampTransport = WebSocketSwampTransport(wsEndpoint:  NSURL(string: "ws://my-router.com:8080/ws")!)
let swampSession = SwampSession(realm: "router-defined-realm", transport: swampTransport)
// Set delegate for callbacks
// swampSession.delegate = <SwampSessionDelegate implementation>
swampSession.connect()
swampSession.disconnect()
```
##### SwampSession constructor parameters
* `realm` - which realm to join
* `transport` - a `SwampTransport` implementation
* `authmethods` `authid` `authrole` `authextra` - See your router's documentation and use accordingly

##### Connection/Disconnection
* `connect()` - Establish transport and perform authentication if configured.
* `disconnect()` - Opposite.

Now you should wait for your delegate's callbacks:

##### SwampSessionDelegate interface
Implement the following methods:

* `func swampSessionHandleChallenge(authMethod: String, extra: [String: Any]) -> String`
  * Fired when a challenge request arrives.
  * You can `return SwampCraAuthHelper.sign("your-secret", extra["challenge"] as! String)` to support `wampcra` auth method.
* `func swampSessionConnected(session: SwampSession, sessionId: Int)`
 * Fired once the session has established and authenticated a session, and has joined the realm successfully. (AKA You may now call, subscribe & publish.)
* `func swampSessionEnded(reason: String)`
 * Fired once the connection has ended.
 * `reason` is usually a WAMP-domain error, but it can also be a textual description of WTF just happened

#### Let's get the shit started!
* **General note: Lots of callback functions receive args-kwargs pairs, check your other client implementaion to see which of them is utilized, and act accordingly.**

##### Calling remote procedures
Calling may fire two callbacks:

* `onSuccess` - if calling has completed without errors.
* `onError` - If the call has failed. (Either in router or in peer client.)

###### Signature
```swift
public func call(proc: String, options: [String: Any]=[:], args: [Any]?=nil, kwargs: [String: Any]?=nil, onSuccess: CallCallback, onError: ErrorCallCallback)
```

###### Simple use case:
```swift
session.call("wamp.procedure", args: [1, "argument1"],
    onSuccess: { details, results, kwResults in
        // Usually result is in results[0], but do a manual check in your infrastructure
    },
    onError: { details, error, args, kwargs in
        // Handle your error here (You can ignore args kwargs in most cases)
    })
```

###### Full use case:
```swift
session.call("wamp.procedure", options: ["disclose_me": true], args: [1, "argument1"], kwargs: ["arg1": 1, "arg2": "argument2"],
    onSuccess: { details, results, kwResults in
        // Usually result is in results[0], but do a manual check in your infrastructure
    },
    onError: { details, error, args, kwargs in
        // Handle your error here (You can ignore args kwargs in most cases)
    })
```

##### Subscribing on topics
Subscribing may fire three callbacks:

* `onSuccess` - if subscription has succeeded.
* `onError` - if it has not.
* `onEvent` - if it succeeded, this is fired when the actual event was published.

###### Signature
```swift
public func subscribe(topic: String, options: [String: Any]=[:], onSuccess: SubscribeCallback, onError: ErrorSubscribeCallback, onEvent: EventCallback)
```

###### Simple use case:
```swift
session.subscribe("wamp.topic", onSuccess: { subscription in
    // subscription can be stored for subscription.cancel()
    }, onError: { details, error in

    }, onEvent: { details, results, kwResults in
        // Event data is usually in results, but manually check blabla yadayada
    })
```

###### Full use case:
```swift
session.subscribe("wamp.topic", options: ["disclose_me": true],
    onSuccess: { subscription in
        // subscription can be stored for subscription.cancel()
    }, onError: { details, error in
        // handle error
    }, onEvent: { details, results, kwResults in
        // Event data is usually in results, but manually check blabla yadayada
    })
```

##### Publishing events
Publishing may either be called without callbacks (AKA unacknowledged) or with the following two callbacks:

* `onSuccess` - if publishing has succeeded.
* `onError` - if it has not.

###### Signature
```swift
// without acknowledging
public func publish(topic: String, options: [String: Any]=[:], args: [Any]?=nil, kwargs: [String: Any]?=nil)
// with acknowledging
public func publish(topic: String, options: [String: Any]=[:], args: [Any]?=nil, kwargs: [String: Any]?=nil, onSuccess: PublishCallback, onError: ErrorPublishCallback) {
```

###### Simple use case:
```swift
session.publish("wamp.topic", args: [1, "argument2"])
```
###### Full use case:
```swift
session.publish("wamp.topic", options: ["disclose_me": true],  args: [1, "argument2"], kwargs: ["arg1": 1, "arg2": "argument2"],
    onSuccess: {
        // Publication has been published!
    }, onError: { details, error in
        // Handle error (What can it be except wamp.error.not_authorized?)
    })
```

## Testing
For now, only integration tests against crossbar exist. I plan to add unit tests in the future.

In order to run the tests:

1. Install [Crossbar](http://crossbar.io/docs/Installation-on-Mac-OS-X/)
2. Go in your shell and type
```bash
cd SwiftWamp_clone_location/
pod install
cd SwiftWampTests/CrossbarInstanceTest
crossbar start
```
3. Open SwiftWamp.xcworkspace
4. Run the tests! (`Product -> Test` or âŒ˜U)

### Troubleshooting
If for some reason the tests fail, make sure:

* You have Crossbar installed and run
* You have an available port 8080 on your machine

## Roadmap
1. MessagePack & Raw Sockets
2. Callee role
3. More robust codebase and error handling
4. More generic and comfortable API
5. Advanced profile features
